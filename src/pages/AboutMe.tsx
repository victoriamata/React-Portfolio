    <h3> Software Engineer</h3>
    <p className="aboutme-p">
    I was born and raised in South Florida before moving to Knoxville, Tennessee, with my family at the age of 16. After five years in Tennessee, I relocated to the Orlando, Florida area with my husband and family. My professional background includes experience in healthcare and banking, but my true passion lies in software development.Two years ago, I discovered the exciting world of programming, and it completely changed the course of my career ambitions. Eager to learn, I started by teaching myself HTML and CSS, but I soon realized I wanted a more comprehensive education. This led me to enroll in the University of Central Florida's full stack coding bootcamp, where I have officially graduated and recieved a certificate from. Iâ€™m thrilled to pursue a career as a Software Engineer, combining my technical skills and creativity to build innovative and impactful projects. I look forward to continuing to grow, learn, and contribute meaningfully in this ever-evolving field.{" "}
