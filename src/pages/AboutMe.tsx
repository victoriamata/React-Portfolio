        I was born and raised in South Florida before moving to Knoxville,
        Tennessee, with my family at the age of 16. After five years in
        Tennessee, I relocated to the Orlando, Florida area with my husband and
        family. My professional background includes experience in healthcare and
        banking, but my true passion lies in software development.

            Two years ago, I discovered the exciting world of programming, and it
            completely changed the course of my career ambitions. Eager to learn, I
            started by teaching myself HTML and CSS, but I soon realized I wanted a
            more comprehensive education. This led me to enroll in the University of
            Central Florida's full stack coding bootcamp, where I have officially
            graduated and received a certificate from. Iâ€™m thrilled to pursue a career
            as a Software Engineer, combining my technical skills and creativity to
            build innovative and impactful projects. I look forward to continuing to
            grow, learn, and contribute meaningfully in this ever-evolving field.
